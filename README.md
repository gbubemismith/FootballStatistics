# FootballStatistics
Using Typescript to analyze football data

Reading through a csv file with Typescript, analyzing the data and making decisons based on the CSV file. Practised a lot of object oriented programming concepts (Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction). I also tried to have use cases based on inheirtance and composition and pick which best suites a situation.
